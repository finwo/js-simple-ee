## Contributing

First, look at the [issues page](https://github.com/finwo/js-simple-ee/issues) to ensure your issue isn't already known. If it's not, you can create a new issue with a detailed description of what happened & how to reproduce the unexpected behavior.

If you decide to take on the challenge of fixing a known (or unknown) issue, you can do so by sending in a pull request from your own fork of the project. Once it has been tested (manually for now) and approved, it will be merged into the master branch of the repository.
